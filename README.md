Scripts used in the study _Predicting psychological recovery after cognitive-behavioural therapy for psychosis in a naturalist sample_

Abstract: Cognitive behavioural therapy is a recommended treatment for psychosis (CBTp). However, not all service users show clinical improvements. This study used machine learning to predict psychological recovery at the individual level following CBTp in 211 service users from a specialised clinic in psychosis. Routinely acquired data on demographics, psychosis, psychological distress, anxiety, depression, illness perception, functioning and wellbeing at pre-treatment were used as input features to predict a service user-led outcome of psychological recovery. A regularised elastic net regression model was able to predict recovery with a balanced accuracy 68.3% at post- treatment and 63.0% at 6-month follow-up. Prediction of recovery was associated with lower severity of hallucinations and anhedonia as well as having a psychosocial-oriented explanation for mental health problems and willingness to change current beliefs about symptoms. We show for the first time the utility and feasibility of data- driven predictions of psychological recovery in service users with psychosis after CBTp in a naturalist setting. Keywords: psychosis, CBT, recovery, machine learning, predictive modelling.
